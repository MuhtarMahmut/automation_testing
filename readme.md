# 🧪 UI Automation Testing Framework (Selenium + PyTest)

This is a scalable and modular UI Test Automation Framework built with **Selenium WebDriver**, **PyTest**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)**. It supports parallel test execution, HTML reporting, Excel/JSON test data handling, reusable utilities, and environment-based configurations.

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### 🔧 `config.ini`

Holds framework settings:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
base_url = https://example.com
browser = chrome
timeout = 10
parallel_threads = 1
headless = false
```

### 🔐 `env.ini`
You can create this file to stores your credentials or API keys
<br>Add this file to the .gitignore after creating<br>


```ini
[Section_Name]
username = YourUsername
password = YourPassword
```


### ⚙️ `pytest.ini`

Used to register markers and customize PyTest behavior:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = -v --tb=short --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py *_test.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*

markers =
    smoke: mark test as part of smoke suite
    regression: mark test as part of regression suite
```
